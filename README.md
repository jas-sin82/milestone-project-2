# Planet IQ Quiz App 

## Interactive Frontend Development Milestone-2 Project

Intention behind to build this Project is educational purpose! In this project I have used HTML for structure , 
CSS for the style to make the app attractive ,Java script for functionality to make the project more user intractive, emailjs to get user feedback about app,and finally 
media query & bootstap to make the project responsive on all devices.

This project presents a Quiz App call Planet IQ. Its not just a Quiz App. Each question contains vital facts which will help user to get more knowledge about our Planet.  

App has a two diffrent webpages each page has diffrent contents and buttons but as user prospective each webpage will easily and smoothly will navigate user to their destination.
Each question has four options, User has one chance to choose the right option and user can't click more the one option, once user click the option if it is right option will turn 
green and if user answer is wrong it will turn in to red and right answer will pop up automatically(green color). At the end of the Quiz user will be able to see the final score card.
